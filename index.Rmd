# Reporting: Statistical Analysis and Results

Data from the fricative dataset were analyzed using a generalized linear model. The model included center of gravity as our dependent variable and skewness as our predictor for the [s] segments. We did not transform our data since after making the scatter plot we could see that the linear regression fits the observed values. In fact, based on the R-squared value (0.8836), we can state that the line predicts 88.36% of the observed values. Moreover, the p-value (7.691e-10) shows that there is a strong correlation between the two variables. Visual inspection of Q-Q plots and plots of residuals against fitted values showed no discernible deviations from normality or homoskedasticity. We also performed a Durbin-Watson Test in order to determine whether there is correlation between the residuals. From the output, we can see that the test statistic is 1.302818 and the corresponding p-value is 0.05. Since this p-value is 0.05, we can conclude that the residuals in this regression model are not autocorrelated.

# Scatter Plot: Assumptions

It would not be appropriate to fit a model to this data because some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them. In this case, fitting a model really does not make sense since the relationship between x and y is definitely not linear.
